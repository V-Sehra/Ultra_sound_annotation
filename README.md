# Ultra_sound_annotation
A webbased tool to annotate ultrasonic videos frame by frame

The tool allows a user to import a standard ultrasonic video.
This video is then processed to crop all sensitive Patient information leaving only the individual frames.
These frames can then be annotated individually to create a machine-learning data set.
This tool is completely GDPR compatible as all data will be stored locally, next to beeing completly open source based, thus no licenes etc. needed.
Currently, the markings are based on determining HCC and CCC cancerous tissue, but can easily be changed.
